# CubiTech
Old MMORPG Bukkit Server Plugin

This is the source code of the main plugin of the obsolete Minecraft Server "CubiTech" (coded many years ago..)

I just wanted to share it.

As far as i remember it offers
- basic features like chat formatting
- an XP-based leveling system
- classes like mage, rogue, hunter, etc. with different skills (for example shooting fireballs, becoming invisible)
- an interactive introduction
- a "war" system between 3 factions
- a customizable teleportation system
- a (more or less) customizable loot system
- flying on a dragon and navigating it
- a mailing/packaging system
.. and much more!

Note:
- some features only make sense with the corresponding map, which i don't have anymore.
  -> If you have it, please contact me!
- the plugin is mostly german and there's no translation feature being used.
- see plugin.yml for the used commands

**!!
This code is NOT written in a good style! I wrote it when i was very young, and did not follow any style guidelines.
I know the coding style is horrible and many things can be structured and implemented MUCH better.
